Better CSV Storage

For User/Programmers who don't want to use databases and want to use csv instead, this script will help manage that csv file (storage) 

What can you do?
- Filter data based on certain conditions
- Update certain values in particular row

How to use?
- It's OOP based so just import it into your script

## Examples

Let's say I want to check and download the status of the files. I can run a script like this:


```python
csv_path = 'dummy_data.csv'

#init class and get the object
csv_obj = BetterCSVStorage(csv_path)

#Now user that object as storage

#Filter Data Based on Different parameters
#This List will contain additional ( update_index ) which is row index of each row in csv.
#This update_index will be use to update value of certain index.
filtered_data = csv_obj.get_filtered_data('download_status', '==', '')

#Change Data Based on Different parameters
csv_obj.update_data(10,'download_status', 'done')
```
